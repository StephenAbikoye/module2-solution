the administrator the ability to manage fax resources such as jobs, settings, reports,
and fax devices on the fax server.
Remote Desktop Services Remote Desktop Services allows for faster desktop and application
deployments to any device, improving remote user effectiveness while helping to keep
critical data secure. Remote Desktop Services allows for both a virtual desktop infrastructure
(VDI) and session-based desktops, allowing users to connect from anywhere.
Security and Protection Windows Server 2012 R2 has many new and improved security
features for your organization. These security features include Access Control, AppLocker,
BitLocker, Credential Locker, Kerberos, NTLM, passwords, security auditing, smart cards,
and Windows Biometric Framework (WBF).
Telemetry The Telemetry service allows the Windows Feedback Forwarder to send
feedback to Microsoft automatically by deploying a Group Policy setting to one or more
organizational units. Windows Feedback Forwarder is available on all editions of Windows
Server 2012 R2, including Server Core.
Volume Activation Windows Server 2012 R2 Volume Activation will help your organization
benefit from using this service to deploy and manage volume licenses for a medium to
large number of computers.
Web Server (IIS) The Web Server (IIS) role in Windows Server 2012 R2 allows an administrator
to set up a secure, easy-to-manage, modular, and extensible platform for reliably
hosting websites, services, and applications.
Windows Deployment Services Windows Deployment Services allows an administrator to
install a Windows operating system over the network. Administrators do not have to install
each operating system directly from a CD or DVD.
Windows Server Backup Feature The Windows Server Backup feature gives an organization
a way to back up and restore Windows servers. You can use Windows Server Backup
to back up the entire server (all volumes), selected volumes, the system state, or specific files
or folders.
Windows Server Update Services Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) allows
administrators to deploy application and operating system updates. By deploying WSUS,
administrators have the ability to manage updates that are released through Microsoft
Update to computers in their network. This feature is integrated with the operating system
as a server role on a Windows Server 2012 R2 system. More Robust Installation Routines If a typical setup program is aborted during the
software installation process, the results are unpredictable. If the actual installation hasn’t
yet begun, then the installer generally removes any temporary files that may have been
created. However, if the file copy routine starts before the system encounters an error,
it is likely that the files will not be automatically removed from the operating system. In
contrast, the Windows Installer allows you to roll back any changes when the application
setup process is aborted.
Ability to Use Elevated Privileges Installing applications usually requires the user to
have Administrator permissions on the local computer because file system and registry
changes are required. When installing software for network users, system administrators
have two options. First, they can log off of the computer before installing the software and
then log back on as a user who has Administrator permissions on the local computer. This
method is tedious and time-consuming. The second option is to give users Administrator
permissions temporarily on their own machines. This method could cause security
problems and requires the attention of a system administrator.
Through the use of the Installer service, the Windows Installer is able to use temporarily
elevated privileges to install applications. This allows users, regardless of their security
settings, to execute the installation of authorized applications. This saves time and
preserves security.
Support for Repairing Corrupted Applications Regardless of how well a network
environment is managed, critical files are sometimes lost or corrupted. Such problems
can prevent applications from running properly and can cause crashes. Windows Installer
packages provide you with the ability to verify the installation of an application and, if
necessary, replace any missing or corrupted files. This support saves time and lessens enduser
headaches associated with removing and reinstalling an entire application to replace
just a few files.
Prevention of File Conflicts Generally, different versions of the same files should be
compatible with each other. In the real world, however, this isn’t always the case. A classic
problem in the Windows world is the case of one program replacing DLLs that are used by
several other programs. Windows Installer accurately tracks which files are used by certain
programs and ensures that any shared files are not improperly deleted or overwritten.
Automated Installations A typical application setup process requires end users or system
administrators to respond to several prompts. For example, a user may be able to choose
the program group in which icons will be created and the file system location to which the
program will be installed. Additionally, they may be required to choose which options are
installed. Although this type of flexibility is useful, it can be tedious when you are rolling
out multiple applications. By using features of the Windows Installer, however, users are
able to specify setup options before the process begins. This allows system administrators
to ensure consistency in installations, and it saves users time.
Advertising and On-Demand Installations One of the most powerful features of the
Windows Installer is its ability to perform on-demand software installations. Prior to the In the following sections, you’ll look at how the processes of assigning and publishing
applications can make life easier for IT staff and users alike. The various settings for
assigned and published applications are managed through the use of GPOs.
Assigning Applications
Software applications can be assigned to users and computers. Assigning a software package
makes the program available for automatic installation. The applications advertise their
availability to the affected users or computers by placing icons within the Programs folder
of the Start menu for Windows 8 (and before) and Windows Server 2012, and within the
Apps area on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
When applications are assigned to a user, programs will be advertised to the user
regardless of which computer they are using. That is, icons for the advertised program will
appear regardless of whether the program is installed on that computer. If the user clicks
an icon for a program that has not yet been installed on the local computer, the application
will automatically be accessed from a server and it will be installed.
When an application is assigned to a computer, the program is made available to any
users of the computer. For example, all users who log on to a computer that has been
assigned Microsoft Office 2013 will have access to the components of the application. If
the user did not previously install Microsoft Office 2013, they will be prompted for any
required setup information when the program first runs.
Generally, applications that are required by the vast majority of users should be assigned
to computers. This reduces the amount of network bandwidth required to install applications
on demand and improves the end-user experience by preventing the delay involved when
installing an application the first time it is accessed. Any applications that may be used by
only a few users (or those with specific job tasks) should be assigned to users.
Publishing Applications
When applications are published, they are advertised, but no icons are automatically created.
Instead, the applications are made available for installation using the Add Or Remove
Programs icon in Control Panel.
